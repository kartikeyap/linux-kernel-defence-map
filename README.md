# Linux Kernel Defence Map

## Intro

Linux kernel security is a very complex area. It would be nice to have some
graphical representation of its current state. So I've created a __Linux Kernel
Defence Map__ showing the relations between:
- vulnerability classes / exploitation techniques,
- kernel defences,
- bug detection means.

__N.B.__ The node connections don't mean "full mitigation". These connections
represent some kind of relation. So ideally, this map should help to navigate
in documentation and Linux kernel sources.

I wrote it in DOT language and generated the picture using GraphViz:
```
dot -Tpng linux-kernel-defence-map.dot -o linux-kernel-defence-map.png
```
So it is very pleasant to maintain this map with git.

If you see any mistakes, feel free to create an Issue or ping me via alex.popov@linux.com
